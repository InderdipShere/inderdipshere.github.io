		    <h1> It's Me !!! </h1>
		    <p> I am working with the CNRS, Montpellier, a southern
		    city in France. Yes, I am a scientist by profession, and
		    it feels good. I am sure I will be a researcher in my
		    possession in any profession in the future. The future
		    behavior is predicted from the trajectories of my previous
		    works and inclination (driving force) towards exploring
		    things.  </p>

		    <p>For a short duration, I have worked as Research
		    Assistance with my Ph. D. group during the pandemic. This
		    duration helped me publish my final articles and train new
		    members of the group. Definitely like to thank my Ph. D.
		    advisor and IRCC for supporting my position. </p> 

		    <p>The Ph.D.ship was my last aspect of my studentship, and
		    I have been a student almost my entire life. Trained with
		    the intention to explore things and learn to be wrong
		    were a few critical aspects of my Ph. D. The thing that
		    itched my mind is science is a simpler explanation of
		    behavior around us. The better we understand it, the
		    simpler we can explain it. Another interesting thing that
		    challenged my belief was working with random numbers in
		    the Monte Carlo process. It was challenging for me to
		    accept the order behavior of random numbers. </p>

			  <h3>Doctorate in Chemical Engineering </h3>
			  <p>I was awarded Ph.D. from Chemical Engineering
			  Department of IIT Bombay, Mumbai.
			  The theme of my was about developing a
			  molecular simulation tool to capture polymerization
			  systems. We developed an algorithm based on the
			  reaction ensemble Monte Carlo to perform polymerization
			  reactions. </p>
			  s

			  <p>We developed various in-house codes to calculate
			  interesting properties like percolation length and
			  porosity of irregular and not periodic structures.
			  We also developed coarse-grained potential for the
			  silica system, which is useful for studying nanoparticle
			  self-assembly with fewer computational resources.  </p>

			  <h3>Masters in Chemical Engineering </h3>
			  <p>I received a Master in Chemical Engineering
			  (M Chem Engg) from ICT Matunga, Mumbai, for the work
			  on Pulse Sieve Plate Extraction Column (PSPEC) under
			  the guidance of Prof. V K Rathod. We used experiments
			  and simulations to develop a model representing axial
			  dispersion in PSPEC. </p>
			   
			   <p> I had an opportunity to do an internship at
			   IPCA, Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. Wherein I worked with
			   a water treatment facility and prepared the compliance
			   report for the government of Madhya Pradesh. </p>

			  <h3>Bachelors in Chemical Techonology (Surface Coating)</h3>
			  <p> My Bachelor's degree is from Chemical Technology
			  of LIT Nagpur, with a specialization in paints and
			  surface coating technology. As a part of a project,
			  I developed green paints that don't require solvent
			  during their formulation and application. The idea was
			  to use the liquid binder (alkyd based) in the
			  formulation, thereby eliminating the need for
			  environmentally harmful solvents. </p>
			  
			   <p> I also did an internship in the paint shop of
			   TATA motors Pune, wherein we had first-hand experience
			   with automotive coatings. </p>
