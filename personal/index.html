		    <h1> Namaste &nbsp; &nbsp;  Hello &nbsp;&nbsp;  Bonjour! </h1>
		    <p> Currently a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS, France,
		    I specialize in molecular simulation with a focus on
		    understanding macroscopic behavior from a
		    molecular perspective. I use Monte Carlo and
		    Molecular Dynamics techniques to simulate multi-length
		    and time molecular events in a system. Molecular events
		    and interactions help me understand and predict the
		    system's behavior at the macroscopic level.
		    For example, we know water exists as ice by knowing how
		    close molecules are packed together. </p>
		    
            <p>Previously, I used silica as a model system to
            establish the role of functionality, concentration,
            and solvent reactivity in governing silica morphology.
            Algorithms were developed to accommodate reactions during
            the simulations so that polymerization could be studied.
            I also developed force fields for the coarse-grained silica
            bead model, observing nano-particle self-assembly and
            percolating structure due to the physical association
            between beads.</p>

            <p> Currently, I am working on a project focused on
            CO<sub>2</sub>
            to methanol conversion-"Artificial Photosynthesis",
            which involves forcefield development and DFT calculations
            of MOF polymer composites. My expertise in molecular
            simulation techniques allows me to approach this project
            with a unique perspective, and I am excited to contribute
            to the field through my research.</p>

			<h3>Reaction Algorithm</h3>
			<p>Scientists have discovered some very interesting
			materials, such as zeolite and aerogels, by combining
			silica molecules. However, because we don't fully
			understand how the silica system works, we have to do
			trial-and-error and adjust different factors until we
			get the desired result. To help us better understand how
			silica molecules behave, we used the Monte Carlo
			technique to simulate their behavior. Our results
			matched what we observed in real-life experiments
			very closely.</p>

			 <p> By studying these simulations, we were able to
			 identify four different stages of the silica
			 polymerization process based on the molecular reactions
			 and shape of the silica aggregate.</p>

			<h3>Porosity Development</h3>
			<p>The process of silica polymerization is commonly used
			to create porous catalysts, but the way these pores are
			formed is not well understood in the absence of
			structure-directing agents or templates.</p>
			
			<p>To shed light on this process, we employed molecular
			simulation to investigate how pores develop. Our
			algorithm allowed us to estimate the porosity of irregular,
			non-periodic particles, and we observed that there are two
			different pathways for pore formation in the silica system.
			The concentration of the precursor and the type of solvent
			used were found to be critical factors in controlling these
			pathways.</p>

			 <p> By creating a concentration-time porosity phase
			 diagram, we can now predict the porosity of a material
			 based on the concentration and reaction time, enabling us
			 to develop materials with the desired porosity.</p>

			<h3>Reaction Mechanisum</h3>
			<p>When we arrange rings in a certain way, we can create
			really cool materials with special properties. But the way
			the rings come together can be hard to predict. To
			understand this process better, we used our algorithm to
			simulate how the rings behave when they're forming and
			arranged. We figured out how likely each ring is to stay
			together before breaking apart and rearranging. This helped
			us make a model explaining the different steps in creating
			the final ring arrangement.</p>

			<p> Knowing how to control the concentration and time of
			the assembly process helps us design materials with
			specific ring arrangements, which is incredible!</p>

			<h3>Coarse-Grained Model</h3>
			<p>Silica nanoparticles are commonly employed for
			delivering drugs, but simulating their formation is a
			tedious process due to the large system size. To
			investigate how silica species interact at a molecular
			level, we created a coarse model that treats the whole
			silica as a single unit. We fine-tuned the interaction
			potential of the coarse particles to align with the actual
			silica species through an iterative process. With this
			forcefield, we analyzed the formation of sizable
			nanoparticles and percolating structures.</p>
			

			 <p> The coarse-grain model enables us to simulate a
			 vast system within a reasonable computational
			 timeframe.</p>

			<h3>Artificial Photosynthesis</h3>
			<p>Artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technology
			that seeks to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis,
			using renewable energy sources to convert carbon dioxide
			into valuable chemicals. As part of this field, my project
			involves developing an advanced material that can capture
			CO<sub>2</sub> and convert it into methanol under solar
			radiation. To achieve this, we need to gain a deep
			understanding of MOF-polymer (PHI) composite. </p>

			<p>We developed an atomistically detailed model for the
			composite using DFT calculation and MD simulation with our
			developed forcefields. We explore the stability of the
			composite, molecular interaction of gas, interfacial
			behavior, charge transfer properties, and interfacial
			porosity. </p>

			<p> This project has the potential to make significant
			contributions to the field of renewable energy and carbon
			capture, and our work in developing an advanced material
			could have important implications for mitigating the
			effects of climate change.</p>

			<h3>Machine Learning Potentials </h3>
			<p>This study employs interatomic potentials in conducting
			large-scale atomistic computer simulations of materials to
			enable the prediction of energy and Newtonian forces. The
			interatomic potential utilized is developed using
			machine-learning techniques and a reference database
			generated through quantum-mechanical calculations.
			Specifically, this machine-learning potential is derived
			from high-dimensional mathematical regression to interpolate
			between reference energies while also incorporating a
			physical base to enhance transferability.</p>
